# Month3Week4 (Getting and Cleaning Data) Course Project

## Raw data for project can be found [here](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

### Raw data comes in form of a zipped folder "UCI HAR Dataset" containing untidy training and test data. When run_analysis.R is run in the parent directory of UCI HAR Datset, two tidy datasets are created. The first combines the training and test data, extracting only the average and standard deviation for each measurement. The second data contains the average of each variable found in the first tidy dataset for each activity and each subject.
